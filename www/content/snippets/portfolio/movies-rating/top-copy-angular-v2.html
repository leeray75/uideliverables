  <p>Here is the second version of the Movies application. It is written in AngularJS and uses a RESTful api that binds the data to a MySQL database</p>
  <p>I added some features to this version such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Searching titles and plots</li>
    <li>Adding new movies to the list</li>
    <li>Users can edit or delete movies. Guest users can edit or delete other guest's movies. Admins can edit or delete any movie.</li>
  </ul>
